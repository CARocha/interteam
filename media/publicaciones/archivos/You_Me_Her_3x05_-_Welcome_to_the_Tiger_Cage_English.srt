Previously on "You Me Her"...

3
00:00:07,347 --> 00:00:08,784
I told you, Izzy, this was a mistake.

4
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:11,110
If you walk out that
door, you are dead to me.

5
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:14,056
Are you sure you left
for the right reasons

6
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:16,167
and you're still getting
a divorce on Monday

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,835
- and driving back to Seattle?
- Yes.

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,179
We agreed that before we started
talking about nannies and daycare,

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,128
the girls would be 3 years old.

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,735
What is wrong with your
entire generation of men?

11
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:25,391
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

12
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:28,263
Well, when I was a kid, my
dad used to leave me at a bar

13
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,469
- while he did God knows what in the back.
- Huh.

14
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:32,565
How long are you gonna
keep showing up like this?

15
00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:35,024
Until you forgive me or my project ends.

16
00:00:35,089 --> 00:00:36,461
You know, what would look really good

17
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:39,299
- on this tiny finger right there?
- Jack, I have an idea.

18
00:00:39,326 --> 00:00:40,949
Why don't I propose to you?

19
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:43,079
- Jack Trakarsky?
- Yes?

20
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:45,578
- I almost proposed to Jack.
- That's awesome.

21
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:48,147
Nina, why is Shaun cooking
dinner in your kitchen?

22
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,158
- You're pregnant.
- I am that.

23
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:53,386
Ky, I'm sorry. It was a massive mistake.

24
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,811
I'll go with you.

25
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,090
You have a right to know.

26
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:11,360
Jack, did you hear what I said?

27
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,360
Yeah, um...

28
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,362
When you say I have a right to know,

29
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,201
we're talking about...

30
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,615
Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:28,527
So what happens now?

32
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,930
Haven't really had a chance
to explore my options.

33
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:36,869
Kylie offered...

34
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,029
to take me.

35
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:41,230
I... I didn't say yes.

36
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,338
I also didn't say no.

37
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,122
- Jack...
- What?

38
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,253
Jack, can we just...

39
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:57,159
can we just sit down and
talk about this like grownups?

40
00:01:57,164 --> 00:01:58,840
Yeah, I'm supposed to be
playing it cool, I guess.

41
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:00,508
That's how you want me to react?

42
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,161
Please. I'm intrigued.

43
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:03,899
Tell me more about your
plan to abort the baby

44
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:05,458
we've been trying to have
for the last seven years.

45
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,726
Okay, can you tone down
the righteous indignation

46
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:09,182
to a seven or an eight, huh?

47
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,383
We both agreed what
happened was a huge mistake.

48
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:13,363
So it's pretty fucking
complicated, Jack.

49
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,541
You know, we shouldn't
have this conversation here.

50
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:16,592
What? Why?

51
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:19,472
Because Izzy has a meeting with
her thesis counselor right now.

52
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,723
"The Myth of Polyfidelity."

53
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:25,624
Great premise. Well done.

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,438
Thanks. Uh, I call it "The
Communism of Relationships"

55
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,384
because it's way better in
theory than it is on its feet.

56
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,221
Fascinating.

57
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:38,124
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

58
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,113
I'm familiar with the
concept of polyamory.

59
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,393
Oh. Okay.

60
00:02:43,518 --> 00:02:48,146
Uh, well, polyfidelity
is the fucktarded effort

61
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:50,955
to make polyamory exclusive
and... and permanent,

62
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:52,190
or so I've read.

63
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:54,442
Why are you so afraid of Izzy?

64
00:02:54,898 --> 00:02:57,588
She would freak out if she knew
I was talking to you right now.

65
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:59,104
She hates you.

66
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,942
Your caller ID on her
phone is "Dead to Me."

67
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:04,180
She didn't return her
father's calls for over a year,

68
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:05,794
and he only left her once.

69
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:07,720
I'm meeting him tonight, by the way.

70
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:10,887
- That's a big step.
- I know.

71
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,725
I've had the engagement
ring in my underwear drawer

72
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:14,926
for five weeks now.

73
00:03:15,644 --> 00:03:18,097
Well, not one to drag
your feet, are you, Jack?

74
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:20,203
Remind me, how quickly
did you jump uteruses?

75
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:21,610
Or... or is it uteri?

76
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:23,874
Feeling fucking wounded, Em, are you?

77
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,933
Okay, well, look at it from
my fucking point of view, okay?

78
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:27,779
My ex-wife shows up in slippers

79
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:29,212
to tell me that her new girlfriend

80
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,975
is gonna be escorting
her to the Abortion Ball.

81
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,355
- Okay, that's so fucking offensive.
- In what fucking way?

82
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:35,478
In the way that I am fucking pregnant.

83
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:42,572
Holy shit.

84
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:45,340
Yeah.

85
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,053
Aside from the obvious...

86
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:51,516
cultural conditioning,
insecurity, jealousy,

87
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:55,004
why do you think polyfidelity is, uh...

88
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,233
"fucktarded"?

89
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,480
Hello?

90
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:01,585
Izzy?

91
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:05,034
I'm 38 years old. I live in Seattle,

92
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,401
where I'm gonna be
managing partner at my firm.

93
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,589
I'm with a woman who has literally said

94
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,750
on multiple occasions
these three words...

95
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,283
- "Babies are gross."
- Is that...

96
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,806
- Dr. Trakarsky...
- Jesus! Wear a bell.

97
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:21,140
So sorry. That came
out very disrespectful.

98
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:26,111
Well, is there a respectful way to
tell your advisor to wear a bell?

99
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:28,746
What is she doing here?

100
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:31,901
Unbelievable.

101
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,623
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

102
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,477
That's why I haven't
RSVP'd to the Abortion Ball.

103
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:42,798
Maybe you decided

104
00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:46,261
you didn't want kids when you
realized you couldn't have them.

105
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,122
You really think now is the
time for "I told you so's"?

106
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,965
Actually, I think this
should be the happiest moment

107
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:54,485
of both of our lives.

108
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,634
Don't have an abortion.

109
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,339
We can figure something out.

110
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,377
Will you at least...

111
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:14,021
think about it?

112
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,741
I will. I promise.

113
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:22,644
Don't say anything to Izzy.

114
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:24,394
Not now.

115
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,794
She and I are just about to
go all in together, and...

116
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,859
You are, um...

117
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,481
undecided.

118
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,434
Are you lost?

119
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:51,055
Couldn't make it in the big city?

120
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,386
Road the rails back to Portland?

121
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,121
These are my driving clothes.

122
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,123
I like to be comfortable.

123
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,611
Well, how 'bout we just
cut straight to the part

124
00:06:00,634 --> 00:06:02,511
where you tell me what
the fuck is going on?

125
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:05,798
I am staying at the
Carlyle. I went for a walk.

126
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,646
It's right over there, just a mile.

127
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,468
And you wore slippers?

128
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,382
Forgot my sneaks.

129
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,460
Okay.

130
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,641
And you didn't tell Jack
you were gonna be in town?

131
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,858
Meeting came together
at the last minute, so...

132
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,524
- You can ask him.
- Oh. I will.

133
00:06:20,818 --> 00:06:22,815
And maybe I'll give you
a call at the Carlyle.

134
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,358
Well, I'm not there. I'm here.

135
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,315
- So...
- You know, just to see if you're registered.

136
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:28,244
Izzy, I don't know why

137
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,335
we can't be amicable.

138
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:32,867
- I... I know that what happened at the loft...
- Look, just stop

139
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:34,888
dropping in and out of our lives.

140
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:37,432
Let us move forward.

141
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,600
Okay.

142
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,249
Yeah, 8's good,

143
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,236
assuming Jack's still alive by then.

144
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:13,043
Oh, no. He's perfectly healthy.

145
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:16,562
But people inexplicably fall out of
windows every day in this country.

146
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,031
Google it.

147
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,656
Okay. Bye.

148
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:23,337
Hello?

149
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,490
Okay. Okay, Silva. Be cool, be cool.

150
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:30,707
Just don't be that girl.

151
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:32,157
Just...

152
00:07:39,103 --> 00:07:42,166
I get... I get that I'm coming
off a little nutty over here.

153
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,993
Um, I'm actually caffeine
sensitive and I just threw back,

154
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:47,545
like, four cups of Kenyan Dark, so...

155
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,168
Okay, now I hear you wondering
why I would drink four cups

156
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,696
of Kenyan Dark if I have a
caffeine sensitivity. Well...

157
00:07:57,705 --> 00:08:00,036
maybe that's why I'm
seeing the head shrinker.

158
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:02,021
Did you ever think of that?

159
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,484
- Hey.
- Hi.

160
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:08,461
- Bumblebutt.
- Bumblebutt?

161
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:09,919
Yeah.

162
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:15,520
- How was your meeting?
- Good. Fine.

163
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:16,966
- Yeah?
- Dad just called.

164
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:20,148
8 still okay? Are you a steak guy?
Is it weird that I don't know that?

165
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:21,801
Hey, we're all steak guys.

166
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:23,247
Some of us just pretend we're not

167
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:25,554
so we can get laid by
some pale skinny women.

168
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:26,821
Hmm.

169
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:29,284
Speaking of pale, skinny women...

170
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,711
You... you saw Emma, too?

171
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,147
Everyone lived?

172
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,284
- Not in my imagination.
- Mm.

173
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:41,706
"Bitterness is like drinking poison

174
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,705
to kill your enemy," young lady.

175
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,262
- Why you talking like that?
- It's a saying.

176
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:47,893
Uh...

177
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:53,531
- It felt like it was from the old times.
- Okay, so, um, why is, uh,

178
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:55,482
why is she here again?

179
00:08:55,511 --> 00:08:57,835
She was at a meeting,

180
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:00,627
- and she's staying at the Carlyle.
- Mm.

181
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,405
That's what she said.

182
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:04,081
- Yeah, that's the gist of it.
- Right.

183
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:06,259
So why is my Spidey sense screaming

184
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,586
that something weird's going down?

185
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,315
I don't know. I mean,
you... we've discussed this.

186
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:15,867
You have no version of
a sixth sense at all.

187
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:17,813
- Right.
- You're way below the mean

188
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:19,534
- when it comes to basic human intuition.
- Oh.

189
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:22,033
So nice try, but off target.

190
00:09:23,253 --> 00:09:24,693
What?

191
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:27,640
Ow.

192
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,586
Maybe don't shave.

193
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,733
He's the one on trial, not you, right?

194
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:34,128
- Your dad? Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

195
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,100
I wanna make a good first
impression. Maybe I'll show up late,

196
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:41,042
- you know, sweat pants on, half-drunk.
- That's perfect.

197
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,276
- That'd be good, right?
- Yeah. It's perfect.

198
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:46,293
Oh! That...

199
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,612
Okay.

200
00:09:47,737 --> 00:09:49,541
- You're leaving? That's it?
- Yeah.

201
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:50,986
All right.

202
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:52,934
- I'll see ya.
- Mm-hmm.

203
00:09:52,937 --> 00:09:54,549
Yeah, have a good one.

204
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:00,796
Fuck me!

205
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,721
Ugh. Mm.

206
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,615
Hey, Carm?

207
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,494
Hi. I just wanna stop by

208
00:10:08,619 --> 00:10:10,272
and say that I love you,

209
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,964
you know, before I go to Seattle
and probably get an abortion.

210
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:18,004
and beg Kylie to forgive me.

211
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:20,129
Oh, and yes, I am mostly
wearing the clothes

212
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,470
that I slept in last night.

213
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:23,675
But for the record,
I did brush my teeth.

214
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,677
Wouldn't that be hysterical? Uh-huh.

215
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,469
Okay, well, I just wanted to play that

216
00:10:34,497 --> 00:10:38,683
clever little prank on you.
So best to you and to yours.

217
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:42,666
You left some banana here.

218
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:47,341
Kind of puts our little
problem into perspective, huh?

219
00:10:47,376 --> 00:10:52,091
Well, it's not little,
So no. No, it doesn't.

220
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:59,758
So do you guys want to play
princesses or princesses?

221
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:03,458
- Princesses.
- All right. To the treasure trunk!

222
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:38,044
Mnh. That's okay. You
just gotta aim better.

223
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,599
So how about school?

224
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,130
- Didn't work out too much.
- Mm.

225
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,201
Nice one.

226
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,981
You really should finish.

227
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,280
You really should
mind your own business.

228
00:11:57,405 --> 00:11:59,139
Okay. Totally cool.

229
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:03,239
- Just getting my volunteer hours.
- You don't know anything about anything.

230
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:09,060
I got kicked out junior
year, but... whatever.

231
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,559
For what?

232
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:18,424
Uh, when my dad bailed, I
went on a bit of a rampage.

233
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,101
Drugs, skipping, failing, fighting,

234
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:24,274
all the things.

235
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:26,562
I went to Algebra on acid.

236
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:29,319
I do not recommend it.

237
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:32,952
Hmm. And now, you're a grad student.

238
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:34,635
I am.

239
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:36,758
Yeah.

240
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:39,982
I tested into a granola bad kids school

241
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:41,947
and I graduated with honors.

242
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:45,078
And then I wrote one
hell of a tearjerker essay

243
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:49,621
- for my college apps.
- Mm-hmm. You're like a PSA.

244
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,483
In the flesh.

245
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:56,282
I can't enroll anyway.
I don't have an address.

246
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,910
- No family at all?
- No.

247
00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:05,881
Well, other than my grandma,
but we haven't talked in years.

248
00:13:05,893 --> 00:13:07,925
And she is nuts.

249
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:14,575
Don't get that stupid
savior look in your eye.

250
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,607
Savior? Me?

251
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:19,704
No. No, no, no. That
is not my thing. No.

252
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:23,067
More of the acid-dropping,
pool shark type.

253
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,978
Mm.

254
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,977
- Go ahead.
- Stop smiling. I'm serious.

255
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,194
- Oh, now I can't smile?
- No.

256
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:33,791
Well, I know you can't smile,
but I'm allowed to smile.

257
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:36,733
Go.

258
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:42,208
Okay, so we've had a few
cancellations for the party tonight,

259
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:43,993
but I think we've got
a good representation

260
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:45,864
from the West Coast princesses, right?

261
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:47,978
Now who was in charge of
snacks? Was that you, Callie?

262
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,935
- Did you bring any snacks?
- No.

263
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:51,950
Oh, was that a little hiccup?

264
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:53,809
Was it a magic hiccup
or just a regular one?

265
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:56,158
You have to have your
gloves. That's important.

266
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:58,438
- Can you help me?
- Yes, of course I can.

267
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:01,386
Is this a left or the
right? Here we go. Your left.

268
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:04,519
- Okay, now can you make your fingers like this?
- Yeah.

269
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:06,805
Hey!

270
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,106
I thought I heard a persistent
ticking in the background.

271
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:12,795
In case you're not clear, that's
another, um, biological clock joke.

272
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:15,287
- You did it!
- I did it. We did it together.

273
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:16,433
What do you want, honey? This one?

274
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:18,022
Put it on nicely, okay?

275
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:27,533
You can be Princess Monsterface.

276
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:30,106
That's a good name for
you, 'cause you really do...

277
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:32,184
Oh.

278
00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:33,894
Jeez, uh...

279
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:36,081
is this about Emma and, um...

280
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,977
Yeah, I mean, she came
all this way to tell me.

281
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,387
That has to mean something, right?

282
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:43,790
Why else would she
just... show up like that?

283
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:47,727
Honestly, I'm, uh, punching out
of my weight class on this one.

284
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,790
- Is Carmen around?
- No, she ran after Emma.

285
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,127
- Grand Central Station here. Here you go, sweetie.
- Mm.

286
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:55,879
What do you think, Princess
Callie? What should I do?

287
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:58,493
- Twirl around.
- Just twirl?

288
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:00,502
- Twirl.
- Oh.

289
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:02,776
Ready? Like this?

290
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:04,549
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

291
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:07,223
Do you want wings? We have extra wings.

292
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:09,091
No, I feel better already.

293
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:10,963
- There you go.
- Thanks. Here.

294
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:14,682
See?

295
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,682
And then I'm thinking that
I'm gonna open up a, uh,

296
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:26,674
my own practice, sex therapy,

297
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:29,092
but with more of a
holistic approach, you know?

298
00:15:29,115 --> 00:15:32,258
That's so cool. And refreshing.

299
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:33,743
How is that?

300
00:15:33,777 --> 00:15:36,500
Hey, I don't like it when
women impugn my entire gender

301
00:15:36,517 --> 00:15:38,331
like we're one giant organism,

302
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:41,451
so I sure as hell don't want
to throw it back the other way.

303
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:43,829
- But...
- But what?

304
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:46,500
Let's just say it ain't easy out there.

305
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:49,142
Word to that, my brother.

306
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:53,679
Okay, time's up. Remember
the parameters of our...

307
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:55,003
Yeah, I'm good for now, but thanks...

308
00:15:55,026 --> 00:15:56,505
intrusive barkeep.

309
00:15:56,528 --> 00:15:59,654
- Right, but you... you told me that...
- No, seriously, I'm... I'm good.

310
00:16:00,011 --> 00:16:02,325
Gotcha. Fuck science, right?

311
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:06,188
Oh, laughing.

312
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:08,060
And how about you,
Captain Sensitive Pants?

313
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:10,184
- Are you... you good?
- Um...

314
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:12,251
- yeah.
- Yeah?

315
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:14,756
That's cool.

316
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,408
Cool.

317
00:16:16,782 --> 00:16:18,308
I don't know.

318
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:20,374
That was interesting.

319
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,482
Yeah, I think they get a... a tax rebate

320
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:24,825
- for employing him.
- I heard that.

321
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,376
- What?
- Not to make this weird, but...

322
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:33,961
I feel like I know you, Nina.

323
00:16:37,836 --> 00:16:39,339
Are you...

324
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:41,060
- did I...
- Did you just say,

325
00:16:41,072 --> 00:16:43,093
"I see you, Nina Martone"?

326
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:46,939
Actually, no, I said, "I
feel like I know you, Nina."

327
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:48,304
Let me guess. You, uh, you got it from

328
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:51,298
"The Millennial Twat's Guide
to Getting Laid" by Andy Cutler?

329
00:16:51,337 --> 00:16:54,590
Wow, so I'm a twat now. Nice.

330
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:56,248
I'm clinging to a thread of hope here.

331
00:16:56,295 --> 00:16:57,929
Uh, are you fucking with me?

332
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,466
What... what does
that even mean, anyway?

333
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:02,368
Like, um, like you...
you can see my soul?

334
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:05,315
The... the vulnerable little girl
that forever lives in my heart?

335
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:08,101
And then, um, seven weeks later,
you wanna slow things down,

336
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:11,710
which apparently is code for "I'm
breaking up with you in nine days"?

337
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:13,944
Did you take an unfortunate
combination of drugs

338
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,643
to prepare for this date?
Or are you just crazy?

339
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:21,025
Oh. Ohh.

340
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,087
- Crazy it is.
- Okay.

341
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:25,562
Yeah, I'd say drinks are on
the house instead of your...

342
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:27,358
your crotch, but, uh...

343
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,490
She works here, so... Yeah. Cool. Oh.

344
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:37,013
I... I need to admit
something to you, okay?

345
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:38,736
So don't fuck it up.

346
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:43,380
Okay, but I'm not that
good under pressure.

347
00:17:43,742 --> 00:17:46,075
I... have a...

348
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:50,317
... pretty girl ego.

349
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:53,754
Oh, is that when I was
supposed to be surprised?

350
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,710
But I've only seriously opened myself up

351
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:58,324
to two guys in my entire life, and...

352
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,801
and they both shat on my head.

353
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:02,694
Disrespectful.

354
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:06,340
And highly coincidental.
Did they know each other?

355
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:09,803
I mean, were they part of, uh,
same scatological fraternity?

356
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:11,266
Right?

357
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,263
Listen, I think we've come up with

358
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:16,222
- the real question of your thesis.
- Oh, fuck.

359
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:18,968
Fine, whatever. I'll bite.

360
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:21,209
What's the real question of my thesis?

361
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,548
"What is wrong with me?"

362
00:18:24,824 --> 00:18:27,023
Like you. You're saying it.

363
00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:28,710
You're saying, "What is wrong with me?"

364
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:31,560
You know? Because you know that's true.

365
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,816
Okay, um, let's clear
some shit up here, Shaun.

366
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,766
First of all, fuck you and
your latest annoying attempt

367
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:42,173
- at bartender wisdom.
- Okay, don't do that. Don't...

368
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:45,017
- don't put up the Nina armor. I'm just trying to...
- And I already have a mejor amiga,

369
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:47,114
fucking clown.

370
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:07,210
Why do I get the sense
that you're correlating

371
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:09,640
me sitting on a swing,
staring at a stuffed octopus,

372
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:11,861
with my wanting to keep this baby?

373
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,487
Am I even necessary
in this conversation?

374
00:19:14,527 --> 00:19:17,607
I should be in my car, on the
way back to Seattle right now.

375
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:20,045
Yet here you are, sitting on a swing,

376
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:21,934
staring at an octopus.

377
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:24,099
You know those people who
are so deep in Scientology

378
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:25,545
that they can't turn back?

379
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:27,885
Like, even when they know
it's about tiny aliens?

380
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:30,624
They just forge on because
it's easier than admitting

381
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,486
how fucked up it all is.

382
00:19:34,328 --> 00:19:37,215
So you're saying Seattle's
your Church of Scientology?

383
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:38,459
Yep.

384
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:43,995
- You don't seem surprised.
- Well, that's mostly because I'm not.

385
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:49,447
Jack was right.

386
00:19:50,495 --> 00:19:52,746
I wasn't following my truths.

387
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,422
I was running away.

388
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:56,506
I mean...

389
00:19:57,018 --> 00:19:59,240
my job is awesome.

390
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:03,714
And Kylie's awesomer.

391
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,790
Well, a lot of things
are awesome and awesomer.

392
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,484
Em, what really matters is,

393
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:13,914
what do you want?

394
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:17,161
I want this baby.

395
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:18,695
And?

396
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,804
And I want my husband.

397
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:26,180
And Izzy.

398
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,302
Do you think Izzy will forgive me?

399
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:34,788
Well, begging for forgiveness
is kind of your thing now, right?

400
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:38,081
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, my
grovel game is on point.

401
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,218
Yellow roses.

402
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:43,317
Did you just have a stroke

403
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,132
and say "yellow roses" out of nowhere?

404
00:20:45,182 --> 00:20:47,476
It's the official flower of apology.

405
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:56,076
See? That's why I love you.
You know shit like that.

406
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:58,840
Oh.

407
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,584
Ugh! How come you always get
to be the caged tiger, okay?

408
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:03,754
Maybe this time, I wanna be the
caged tiger. You think about that?

409
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:05,163
It's a big cage.

410
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:07,244
- So what? We're supposed to do it at the same time?
- Why not?

411
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:08,326
That's new.

412
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:11,052
Do I just... do I...

413
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:12,627
- You just walk.
- Do I like it?

414
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:16,501
- Fuck, yeah. I think I might like it.
- You do. It's good. You first.

415
00:21:16,955 --> 00:21:18,168
- Fucking Shaun.
- What?

416
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:19,849
No, no.

417
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:22,483
No, not me fucking Shaun. Like,

418
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:24,294
God, no. Shaun's pissing me off.

419
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:27,126
Okay. So Shaun can piss you off now?

420
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,360
Which means you give a damn about Shaun.

421
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:31,207
Um, that is so stupid.

422
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:34,004
Just stop saying stupid shit
and try to be less stupid.

423
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:36,872
He's big and he's furry and
he wears a rotation of, like,

424
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,243
- four weird t-shirts.
- Okay, I get it. Shaun's not your type.

425
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:42,684
So, uh, what'd he do to piss you off?

426
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:45,867
He... he says that my
thesis isn't really about

427
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:47,368
the plight of the millennial male...

428
00:21:47,418 --> 00:21:48,782
that it's about me.

429
00:21:48,837 --> 00:21:50,131
- No.
- Yeah.

430
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:52,485
Yeah. And h's, um, he says
that I'm trying to figure out

431
00:21:52,503 --> 00:21:54,732
what's wrong with me,
why guys keep leaving me.

432
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,191
- Can you believe that?
- No.

433
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:57,978
Yeah. And...

434
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:01,299
Wait. Wait are you saying
no, like, "No fucking shit"?

435
00:22:01,341 --> 00:22:02,552
Yeah, I am.

436
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:05,375
Nina, there's been 2 guys in 10 years.

437
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:07,195
Three including today's thesis date,

438
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:09,139
- who was actually a really cool guy.
- Okay.

439
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,165
And he, um, took off

440
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:15,309
when I called him a twat and
threw a drink in his face.

441
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:18,521
What a pussy.

442
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:21,891
Right?

443
00:22:21,903 --> 00:22:24,488
- Oh, okay.
- I... I just...

444
00:22:24,522 --> 00:22:26,353
I can't shake this
feeling that Emma's here

445
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:29,034
for more than a business
meeting, you know?

446
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,584
- What the fuck?
- I ordered pizza.

447
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:33,087
- Oh. Sweet.
- Yeah.

448
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:35,062
I'm starving.

449
00:22:38,228 --> 00:22:40,468
Um...

450
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:44,205
You can't talk to me like that,

451
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:47,601
especially in front of customers.

452
00:22:48,206 --> 00:22:50,710
Um... o... okay.

453
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:54,809
So however it's going to
be between us, it is not...

454
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,526
it is not gonna be like that.

455
00:22:58,423 --> 00:23:00,860
Fine. Um, I'm sorry.

456
00:23:01,101 --> 00:23:02,655
And I'll work on it.

457
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:04,855
Okay.

458
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,749
Uh...

459
00:23:07,106 --> 00:23:09,314
- Izzy.
- Shaun.

460
00:23:10,652 --> 00:23:12,955
Okay. So to be continued.

461
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:14,886
Yeah.

462
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:18,286
Hmm.

463
00:23:27,537 --> 00:23:31,569
So... what have we learned
here today in the tiger cage?

464
00:23:31,913 --> 00:23:34,699
Shaun's got a surprisingly
impressive pair.

465
00:23:36,408 --> 00:23:39,176
And you need to stop
obsessing over Emma.

466
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:41,348
- Want a beer?
- Yeah.

467
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,271
Damn it.

468
00:23:50,188 --> 00:23:52,115
Uh, maybe we could save this look

469
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:54,426
for the second time we meet my dad?

470
00:23:59,664 --> 00:24:02,961
Oh, my God. You are nervous.

471
00:24:02,979 --> 00:24:05,046
That is very cute.

472
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:09,273
It's the first time I met
someone's dad since Hal Seaver.

473
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:12,191
Yeah? And how did that go?

474
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,979
He gave me a pamphlet
for conversion therapy.

475
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,523
Ha ha. Well...

476
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,540
- well, it looked like it worked.
- Mm.

477
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,524
But you have to wait until we get home.

478
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:26,315
Okay, then I'm gonna
challenge your father

479
00:24:26,324 --> 00:24:28,860
to a speed eating contest.

480
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:34,886
- I love you.
- Well, duh. I'm touching on your privates.

481
00:24:37,802 --> 00:24:39,379
I'll get this one 'cause...

482
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,282
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You know...

483
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:43,263
Okay, I'll pick out

484
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:45,474
the perfect pair of
father-meeting undies.

485
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:47,312
Mm-hmm.

486
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,621
Oh, hey, Em. What the
fuck are you doing here?

487
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:06,960
Yellow roses, the
official flower of apology.

488
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,645
Would it help if I knelt?
Others have enjoyed it.

489
00:25:11,703 --> 00:25:13,593
That seems excessive.

490
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,373
But I would move one way
or the other if I were you.

491
00:25:16,374 --> 00:25:17,976
Why?

492
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:20,898
I dig the vase.

493
00:25:21,023 --> 00:25:22,763
What'd I tell you this morning, Em?

494
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,893
I told you to stay the fuck away.

495
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:26,750
Did it seem like I was joking?

496
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:29,171
Yes, would you please just hear me out?

497
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:31,488
Who was that?

498
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,719
It was just some lost chick.

499
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:35,533
A lost chick with a vase?

500
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:37,433
I know. That's weird, right?

501
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
